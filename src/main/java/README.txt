Description of Additional Report (A3f):
As part of the requirement for section A3f, I chose to create a report that displays how many customers
are part of each country. The report generates a tableview that uses the database to display all countries
with customers, and how many customers there are for each country. Please note, only countries with
customers are displayed, customers with zero customers are not displayed in the report.
